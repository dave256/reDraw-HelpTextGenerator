* Pressing command-/ on an externally connected keyboard will create a text drawable below the bottom item on the current slide no matter what drawing tool is currently selected.

* Added Previous/Next slide buttons on either side of slide number button. Pressing the slide number displays a view for picking any slide.

#### Where are my documents created in earlier versions of reDraw

Documents created with reDraw version 2.0 and earlier are found by navigating to the "On My iPad" section under Locations in the left sidebar. Next, select reDraw, then select Documents, and then you may need to select Documents again. That folder contains your previously created folders and reDraw documents. See [Renaming and moving documents](#renaming-and-moving-documents) for to rename documents or how to move them to different folders.

##### Creating a new document

If you have navigated to a folder where you can create reDraw documents such as On My iPad -> reDraw -> Documents or any subfolder of it or one of the cloud providers that fully supports the cloud drive options such as as iCloud Drive, you should see a + button with the subtitle Create Document that you can press. You should also see a + button at the top right the left of the Help button. Note that you cannot store documents in the sandboxed folder of other apps listed in the On My iPad section. Within the On My iPad section, only the reDraw folder and its subfolders may be used.

After pressing the + button you can choose the canvas size for the document and the app will be created in the currently select folder with the name "Note (current date)". See [Renaming and moving documents](#renaming-and-moving-documents) for to rename documents or how to move them to different folders.
